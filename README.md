# Operating Systems Project

Designed and implemented a real-time task scheduler using the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm in C++. Simulated task execution with POSIX threads, semaphores, and pipe-based logging to ensure synchronized, deadline-aware scheduling. Integrated a custom scheduler and logger to simulate non-preemptive real-time behavior with accurate time tracking using chrono library.
